# Real-Estate
I have analyzed real estate market in India using segmentation analysis and design a feasible strategy to enter the market targeting potential segments.
I have collected housing and rental data of eight cities in India, merged the files to generate a single dataset, cleaned and processed the data for segmentation.
Algorithms used: We used Python libraries like pandas, numpy, sklearn, os, pyplot, etc. for the analysis. The algorithm used for segmentation is K-means clustering. This is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that groups the data into clusters having some commonality in it. 'K' here is the number of data points in a group with the nearest mean. It minimizes within the clusters squared Euclidean distances.
## Result
We could segment the data based on Geographical, Demographic, Psychographic and Behavioral aspects. Segmentation is important for devising a strategy for launching a product or service provided by the company. In this project, we could identify the target segments that will use the 'Rental housing app'. This method can help any start-up looking to launch its product and create a niche for itself in the market.
